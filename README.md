Proof of concept about Internet Explorer plugins (ie11)

This project was created with Visual Studio Community 2019 and it's a Plugin for IE (only tried it with Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 (Home Edition). It has also an installer project to install/uninstall the plugin (no need to install/unistall) for testing purposes.
